# Community Repository Template

A template for creating clear, collaborative, and well-governed community content repositories.

## Why This Matters

Managing community content and contributions can be challenging. Communities need clear structures for documentation, decision-making processes, and collaboration guidelines. This template provides a foundation that promotes engagement while maintaining quality and organization.

## Our Approach

We focus on three key elements:

1. **Clear Structure**: Organized documentation and intuitive navigation
2. **Community Governance**: Templates for surfacing tensions, ideas, and improvements
3. **Quality Control**: Peer review processes and contribution guidelines

## What We Do

- Provide templates for common community needs (README, issues, pull requests)
- Structure documentation for clarity and maintainability
- Guide communities in establishing effective governance
